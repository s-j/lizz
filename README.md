A small project I wrote in a [TDT4230 Visualization and Graphics](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TDT4230) back in 2006. It implements a simple scene graph, quaternions, splines, shadows, .obj-import and collision detection. A detailed description (written in Norwegian) can be found in [the attached project report](https://github.com/s-j/lizz/blob/master/vizz.pdf).

Instructions for installing drivers, compiling and launching on Ubuntu 14.04:

```
   sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev 
   sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev
   make all
   ./acidtrip
```
