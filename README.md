A small project I wrote in a Visualization and Graphics course a few years ago. Implements a simple scene graph, quaternions, splines, shadows, .obj-import and collision detection.

Installing drivers, compiling and launching on Ubuntu 14.04:

```
   sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev 
   sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev
   make all
   ./acidtrip
```
